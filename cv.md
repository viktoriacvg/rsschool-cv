### **About myself**
I started to study web-development over a year ago. At first I have studied HTML Ð¸ CSS and in the course of studying created mini projects. I spend all my free time for education. It is very exciting and the more I learn, the more interesting it becomes for me to go further. Yes, there are difficulties, but they spur me even more to go forward and do not give up. The profession - Frontend Development provides endless opportunities for professional growth.

### **Code examples**
***Kata from Codewars: Sort array by string length.***
Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.
For example, if this array were passed as an argument:["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]
Your function would return the following array: ["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]
All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths, so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length.
```
function sortByLength (array) {
      return array.sort(function compare(a, b) {
         if (a.length > b.length) return 1;
         if (a.length == b.length) return 0; 
         if (a.length < b.length) return -1;
       })
};
```
